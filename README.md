# stock-price-prediction
To predict stock price using deep learning algorithms
This project consists of 3 files , one with the technical indicators as the dataset calcualted using the yahoos historical data with ta library from python.
A random forest along with other ml algorithms are implemented to check for the data as well as the important features.
The second file was about predicting the daily stock prices with the help of keras lstm and gru .
The third file was to predict the intraday stock prices using keras lstm and gru.
All the training was done on a server with a least error rate and the predictions are good enough to earn profits for daily traders with a historical company stocks example are google, apple etc..
